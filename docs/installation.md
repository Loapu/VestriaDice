# Installation

## Dependencies

VestriaDice is built against the [Paper 1.17 API](https://papermc.io/downloads#Paper-1.17). Therefore you *cannot* use VestriaDice with Bukkit or Spigot. Any of the actively maintained Paper forks (Tuinity, Purpur, etc.) should work. If you encounter any problems make sure to open an Issue right here on GitHub.

After making sure that you use the right server software, download the [CommandAPI](https://commandapi.jorel.dev/) Plugin in its latest version and drag & drop it inside your plugins folder.

## Installation

All dependencies set? Alright, now drag & drop VestriaDice inside your plugins folder and restart your server. Please remember, neither a reload of the server nor the plugin will work, you have to restart the whole server.
